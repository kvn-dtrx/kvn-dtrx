## Synopsis

Since the reader has most likely arrived at this page via my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-kd-dietrich), he is presumably interested in an examination of my repositories related to data science and machine learning.[^else] For this purpose, I have prepared a [slide show](https://kvn-dtrx.github.io); alternatively, one may scroll down to the pinned repositories.

[^else]: Otherwise, I may offer an inspiring [quotation](https://github.com/kvn-dtrx/kvn-dtrx/blob/main/quote.md) or some unrelated [fun fact](https://github.com/kvn-dtrx/kvn-dtrx/blob/main/fun-fact.md) about myself.

<!-- NOTE: Relative links will not work at this place: GitHub would resolve `./foo` to `https://github.com/foo! -->
