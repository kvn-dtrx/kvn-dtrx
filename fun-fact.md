# Fun Fact: My Preference Relations

As a fun fact, I disclose my canonical *preference relations* on three significant sets of popular culture.

In contrast to [genuine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_relation) preference relations, mine are indeed always complete â€” though possibly not transitive!

## *Star Wars*: Skywalker Saga Episodes

``` text
  Hope    > Empire > Revenge
> Menace  > Jedi   > Attack
> Force   > Return > Rise
```

## *Star Trek*: Shatner-Stewart Films

``` text
  Contact     > Nemesis > Motion
> Frontier    > Wrath   > Country
> Generations > Search  > Insurrection > Voyage
```

## *Middle-Earth*: Peter Jackson's Films

``` text
  Return > Fellowship > Towers 
> Battle > Desolation > Journey
```
